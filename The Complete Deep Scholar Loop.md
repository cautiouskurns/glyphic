  3. Book Appears on Desk (Feature 4.1)

  The popup closes. On your desk, a cream-colored book slides in 
  from the right with a gentle animation. It settles near the
  magnifying glass, pulsing softly to draw your attention.

  The book shows:
  - Cream cover (Mrs. Kowalski's book color)
  - "Family History" in small text
  - Slight shadow, 8° rotation (natural placement)

  Your workspace now has:
  - Papers (left)
  - The book (center-right, glowing)
  - Magnifying glass (hovering over book)
  - Dictionary (right)
  - Bell (far right)

  ---
  4. Examination Phase (Feature 4.2 Enhanced)

  You click the Magnifying Glass.

  Examination panel slides in (520×650px, brown header):

  You hover over the symbols. Golden crosshairs appear. The zoom
  window shows each symbol magnified 2×.

  Observations:
  - This is a family history
  - From Warsaw, 1924
  - Contains symbols: ∆ ◊≈ ⊕⊗◈
  - Mrs. Kowalski seems sweet, trustworthy
  - No need for library yet (this is your first book!)

  5. Translation Phase

  You click "Begin Translation".

  The Examination panel stays open. Translation panel slides in next
   to it (500×650px, cream header). Now you have 2 panels open 
  side-by-side.

  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  You puzzle over the symbols. Since this is Text 1 (the easiest),
  and you're new, you might:
  - Guess based on the visual patterns
  - Notice ∆ looks like "the"
  - Try combinations
  - Use the Hint button (shows: "Simple word substitution")

  After some trial, you type: the old way

  You click Submit.

  9. Examination with Cross-Reference (Feature 4.6)

  Click Magnifying Glass.

  Examination panel shows:
  - Scholar #412's book
  - Symbols: ∆ ◊≈ ⊕⊗◈ ⊕⊗⬡ ⬡∞◊⊩⊩≈⊩
  - Origin: University Archive
  - "I need this for my thesis on forgotten languages."

  You notice: Hey, the first three symbols are the same as Mrs.
  Kowalski's book!

  You click "📚 Consult Library".

  The Library panel opens alongside Examination. The search box
  auto-fills with ∆ (the first symbol).

  Library shows:
  Results (1):

  10. Translation with Knowledge

  Click "Begin Translation".

  The Translation panel shows:
  Known Symbols:
  • ∆ = "the" (HIGH CONFIDENCE) ← From your library!
  • ◊≈ = "old" (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
  • ⊕⊗◈ = "way" (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
  • ⊕⊗⬡ = ??? (unknown)
  • ⬡∞◊⊩⊩≈⊩ = ??? (unknown)

  You know the first 3 words already! Just need to deduce the last
  2.

  Pattern recognition:
  - ⊕⊗◈ = "way"
  - ⊕⊗⬡ starts with ⊕⊗ (same prefix)
  - Maybe a similar word? "was"?

  You type: the old way was forgotten

  Submit. ✓ Correct! +$100

  11. Note-Taking (Building Connections)

  Note editor appears:

  Translation Complete!
  "the old way was forgotten"

  Add a note?

  You type:
  "Builds on Kowalski's text! Same symbols (∆ ◊≈ ⊕⊗◈).
  Pattern: ⊕⊗ = 'wa-' sounds? Both 'way' and 'was'.
  'Forgotten' - ominous. What old way was forgotten?"

  Save Note.

  The Loop Continues...

  Jobs 3-5 (Same Day)

  You accept 3 more customers. Each time:
  1. Authentication check (spot any fakes?)
  2. Examine book (read provenance, context)
  3. Consult library (find related symbols)
  4. Translate (using accumulated knowledge)
  5. Add note (capture insights)
  6. Library grows

  Capacity: 5/5 (Maxed out for the day)

  Cash: $150 → $450 (after 5 jobs)

  Library: 5 books (growing knowledge base)

  Day 2: Tuesday

  New Features Unlock

  You see a popup:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

  You don't have $500 yet (only $450 after utilities). You skip for
  now.

  A Forgery Appears

  Day 2 queue includes Merchant #819.

  Authentication check:
  Paper Age:        ⚠ Suspicious
    Modern brighteners detected
  Binding Style:    ✗ Anachronistic
    Machine-stitched (not period)
  Ownership Marks:  ✓ Present
    But looks fabricated

  VERDICT: ⚠️ LIKELY FORGERY

  Decision point:
  - Accept anyway? (Risky - might translate to gibberish, waste
  time)
  - Refuse politely? (Safe - merchant leaves, no penalty)
  - Expose the fake? (Confrontational - reputation boost, but
  merchant angry)

  You refuse. "I don't think this is authentic, sorry."

  Merchant leaves embarrassed. No job, but you saved time.

  Day 3: Dr. Chen Appears

  Dr. Chen brings a research journal.

  Authentication:
  Paper Age:        ✓ Authentic
  Binding Style:    ✓ Consistent
  Ownership Marks:  🔒 Hidden (UV required)

  VERDICT: ✓ Authentic (but mystery remains)

  You examine the book:
  - Origin: University Archive
  - "This is critical for my research. Something is waking up."
  - Symbols: ∆ ◊≈ ⊞⊟≈ ⬡≈≈⊢⬡

  Wait... ∆ ◊≈ again? That's "the old" (confirmed from library).

  Consult Library:
  Search: ∆
  Results (7 books now)
  All contain ∆ = "the"

  New symbols: ⊞⊟≈ and ⬡≈≈⊢⬡

  You translate: the old god sleeps

  Success! Dr. Chen: "Excellent. This confirms my fears."

  Your note:
  "'The old god sleeps' - WHAT?! Chen seemed worried.
  First mention of deity. Connection to 'old way'?
  Are all these texts about the same thing?"

  ---
  Day 4: The Pattern Emerges

  Your library now has 15 books.

  You search for "god":
  Results (3):
  - Dr. Chen (Day 3): "the old god sleeps"
  - Scholar #621 (Day 4): "magic was once known"
  - Merchant #107 (Day 2): "the old way was forgotten"

  You realize: These aren't random jobs. They're all connected.

  Opening your library feels like a detective's cork board:
  - Family histories → References to "old ways"
  - Academic texts → Mention of "forgotten" magic
  - Dr. Chen's work → Warns of something "sleeping"

  Your notes create a narrative:
  Day 1: "Old way" - vague
  Day 2: "Was forgotten" - loss
  Day 3: "Old god sleeps" - ominous
  Day 4: "Magic was once known" - confirmation

  ---
  Day 7: The Stranger

  The Stranger arrives with a black book.

  Authentication:
  Paper Age:        ⚠ Too Perfect
    Looks brand new (suspicious)
  Binding Style:    ⚠ Unknown Style
   Never seen this before
  Ownership Marks:  🔒 "PROPERTY OF THE ORDER ⊗"
    (UV Light reveals this)

  VERDICT: ??? Uncertain
  Looks fake, but UV mark is VERY old

  This is the twist. It looks like a forgery, but the UV mark is
  authentic.

  Examine:
  - Origin: Unknown
  - The Stranger: "You don't need to know. Just translate it."
  - Symbols: ∆≈◊ ⊗◈≈ ◈≈∆◊◈⊩∞⊩⊞ ⬡◊◊⊩

  Consult Library:

  You search ∆≈◊. No exact matches. This is new.

  But you notice patterns:
  - ∆ = "the" (known)
  - ◊ appears in "old" (◊≈)
  - ⊗◈ appears in "magic" (⊗◈⊞∞◈)

  Deduction through cross-reference:
  - ∆≈◊ might be "they" (related to "the")
  - ⊗◈≈ might be "are" (related to "magic")
  - ◈≈∆◊◈⊩∞⊩⊞ = ???
  - ⬡◊◊⊩ = ???

  You puzzle it out using your library. After consulting 10+
  books...

  You translate: they are returning soon

  The Stranger: "You've done well. Keep this between us."

  ---
  What You've Built

  By Day 7, your library is a living document:
  - 35 books translated
  - Notes connecting them all
  - Patterns revealed through cross-reference
  - The story emerged organically from your work

  Opening the library feels like:
  - Opening Obra Dinn's notebook (all the pieces clicking)
  - Reading a mystery novel (clues you gathered yourself)
  - Being a real scholar (cross-referencing, pattern recognition)

  ---
  The Core Loop (Summary)

  Every job follows this flow:

  1. Queue → Select customer
  2. Authentication → Spot forgeries (optional but engaging)
  3. Examination → See book, read provenance, understand context
  4. Consult Library → Cross-reference past work (becomes essential
  by Day 3+)
  5. Translation → Solve puzzle using accumulated knowledge
  6. Note-Taking → Capture insights (builds narrative)
  7. Library Growth → Book saved, searchable forever

  The magic:
  - Early jobs teach symbols (dictionary builds)
  - Later jobs require cross-reference (library becomes essential)
  - Notes create narrative (you discover the story through your own
  observations)
  - Authentication adds tension (not every job is safe)
  - Forgeries create risk (do you trust the customer?)

  It feels scholarly because:
  - You build expertise over time
  - Tools have purpose (UV Light unlocks hidden info)
  - Library is your second brain
  - Cross-referencing is rewarded (faster solving)
  - Notes make connections explicit

  And it feels like a mystery because:
  - Texts reference each other
  - Patterns emerge gradually
  - Your notes become the investigation log
  - Day 7 payoff only works if you've been paying attention

  ---
  That's the full loop. Does this vision feel right? The key is that
   the library transforms from optional reference to essential tool
  as the game progresses.
